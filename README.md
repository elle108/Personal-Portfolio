# Elle Miller's Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built as part of my application to GVSU Blue Nucleus to showcase my projects, experience, and interests as a computer science student. It also includes a contact form backed by Firebase, allowing visitors to reach out directly.

The site is designed to be clean, calm, and approachable, with a soft pastel theme inspired by Sanrio, while still keeping the focus on my technical work.

## Features

- Multi page React application (Home, About, Projects, Contact, Admin)
- Design using Tailwind CSS
- Firebase Firestore for contact form submissions
- Firebase Authentication for admin only access
- Admin dashboard to view contact submissions
- ShadCN UI components for consistent styling
- Deployed with Vercel

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Authentication)
- **Routing:** React Router
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Admin Access

- Contact form submissions are stored securely in Firestore
- Only authenticated users can view submissions
- Firestore rules prevent updates or deletions of contact data

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at
http://localhost:5174

## Future Development
- Continue to update information as education progresses
- Add animations and UI transitions
- Improve admin dashboard
- Improve UI for a cleaner and polished webpage
- Add resume download
